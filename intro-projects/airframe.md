# Airframe

## Intro Project - New Members

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_9630%20%281%29.jpg)

The new members will be tasked with designing an L1 rocket to show:

1. Basic knowledge of rocket design and component function
2. Commitment to learning new things
3. Work within a budget

The Airframe meetings at the start of the year - along with the GitBook - will contain all the information required to complete the project. In addition, I will hold office hours **Thursdays 4pm-6pm PDT** via Zoom, so please stop by and ask any questions you may have. The Zoom link will be provided on in the Airframe Discord channel. If these scheduled office hours do not work for you, please feel free to reach out to me and schedule a different meeting time.

#### Constraints:

1. $400 budget \(including motor\)
2. Minimum 1,000 ft Apogee \(simulated at Snow Ranch conditions\)
3. **Project due 10/2**

#### Project **Deliverables**:

1. Report outlining design choices 

     a. Simulation data included

2. Line-item budget

     a. Should include supplier

3. OpenRocket model \([Guide on how to use OpenRocket](https://calstar.gitbook.io/docs/tutorials/airframe/airframe-openrocket)\)
4. SolidWorks CAD model
5. Procedures on how to assemble it
6. Powerpoint presentation outlining all of the above
7. Should be able to explain any question
8. Build days will be optional events, but are you are highly recommended to attend, given that we have approval to hold in person meetings.

**Given / Outside Scope of Project:**

1. Parachute sizes depending on mass and reasonable drift estimates
2. Specific separation procedures knowledge
3. Others as they come up will be added here

**Level 1 Build:**
The original goal was for new members to be able to collectively build a Level 1 rocket, using the designs you each created, and launch the rocket. The purpose of this collective project is for new members to gain hands-on experience building a high powered rocket. This will likely not happen during the fall semester given the circumstances created by coronavirus. If conditions do improve by spring semester, this is something that the new members of Airframe will pursue. 

## Returning Members Intro Project

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_5739%20%281%29.jpg)

The returning member project for Airframe will be the design of a 4 inch diameter stage separation rocket. You may use the examples of a stage separation ork provided on the STAR Google Drive in the folder Systems>StageSep Documents. Specs will be updated as decided by Systems.
